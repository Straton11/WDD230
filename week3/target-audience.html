          A mother of two kids. She is an online yoga instructor and a writer.
          She spends a day with her kids on weekends and makes sure to give them
          a wholesome adventure whenever possible, so she depends on the weather

            A group of teenagers went for a trip in the mountain and lost track
            of their way home. They determined Klustergrant geocoding location
            information and found access to a safety travel/transportation
            scheme. They could not believe a weather forecast site could help
            them find their way home.

            An athlete decided to take a run in the outback and checked the
            safety weather for a run. He didn't have access to Klustergrant, but
            his outdated mobile phone had free-dial access to keep up with the
            weather forecast during that day.

            An American businessman is planning a trip to Osaka, Japan, to meet
            with business partners. The urgency of the meeting cut short his
            plan into a week. He heard a super typhoon hitting Osaka with
            landfall time the same day he wished to go. He took out his laptop
            and inquired Klustergrant for safety options to save the day for his
            business trip.

            A group of doctors decided to provide a 3-day covid vaccination in
            an open area on a first-come-first-served basis. They offered
            reservations via the link provided for the public and encouraged
            everyone to use the link access of Klustergrant to see the weather
            conditions. The aspirants were guided with the safety travel/
            transportation schemes and informed to prepare umbrellas or
            raincoats according to the weather forecast. They received an update
            on the weather of the vaccination days.

            The Local Athletic committee decided to pursue a 5-day athletic meet
            highlighting the final and championship relays on the fifth day. The
            chairperson refers to Klustergrant for the best weather options with
            five consecutive fine days within two weeks of available weather
            forecasts. They decided to adjust the starting day earlier than
            planned after knowing that the final day had heavy rainfall. Thanks
            to Klustergrant.
